abstract: This paper is devoted to discussing the exponential synchronization of a class of nonlinearly coupled complex networks (NCCNs) with time-varying delays and stochastic disturbance. In consideration of the complex networks would subject to certain impulse disturbances, a kind of distributed controller combining with pinning control and impulsive control schemes is designed. Based on the concept of average impulsive interval and comparison principles, sufficient conditions for achieving the exponential synchronization are derived. In addition, the exponential convergence velocities are obtained, respectively, with considering different functions of the impulsive inputs. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the theoretical deduction.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
